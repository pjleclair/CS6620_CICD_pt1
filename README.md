# CS6620_CICD_pt1

### This Python app is a simple network request to a public API that returns cryptocurrency data.

### The returned data is then printed to console.

### I included a small test to ensure that data is returned, which is ran as part of the GitHub pipeline.

### To install, clone the repo and create a conda environment:
`git clone git@github.com:pjleclair/CS6620_CICD_pt1.git`

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

### Then simply run the app:

`python3 app.py`
